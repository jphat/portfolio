Creative department is supposed to be a happy and diverse environment. And some say it is. Of course, you can't expect men, mostly white, straight, well-traveled and with a high-income standard, to understand that this is a much more hostile and oppressive place than it seems. An environment that pushes women away. That is why many of them decide to give up working at agencies. And don't think this is a cowardly act. You have to have a lot of courage to give up your career and dreams for a little self-love.

Not mentioning this absurd culture where the more you work, the more people value you. In a sexist and patriarchal society, balancing this agency life with the home and motherhood routines is not easy.
